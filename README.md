# patient_matching
Program to automate matching incoming pdf documents to corresponding patient electronic medical record (EMR)

Currently, staff scans incoming faxes, uploads to EMR, and manually enters document info (dob, first, last, doctype, date of document) for each indiviudal fax. This program aims to reduce time spent on this task.
